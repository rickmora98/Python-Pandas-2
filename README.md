<h1> Py City Schools <br> (Using Python and Pandas to analyze academic performance in a fictitious school district) </h1>

This Jupyter notebook (PyCitySchools.ipynb) demonstrates several ways to use Pandas data frames to analyze student academic
performance in the fictitious Py City School District.  Specifically, does a school's size, budget, or type (charter or district)
have any influence on it's students' math and reading scores.
The input data comes from csv files "schools_complete.csv" and "students_complete.csv". 
There is not an output data file, but all output is contained within the notebook and appears below each corresponding code cell.
